## A personal portfolio of web development projects

- Human-readable files: `/app`.
- Development temporary builds: `/app/temp`
- Production files: `/docs`

This project makes use of:
- Semantic tagging in the HTML & CSS, in which I try to make it posible for anyone to trace CSS tags to their HTML counterparts
- Highly resopnsive images that adapt to screen size and resolution
